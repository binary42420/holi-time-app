# OAuth Authentication Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Database Setup**: 
   - Admin users exist in database (ryley92@gmail.com, paul@handsonlabor.com, Robertflo134@gmail.com)
   - All users have Admin role and are active

2. **NextAuth Configuration**:
   - Google OAuth provider is properly configured
   - JWT strategy is working
   - Environment variables are correctly set
   - NextAuth API endpoints are responding

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - JWT callback properly fetches user data from database for OAuth users
   - Session callback correctly sets user role and permissions
   - Middleware role-based access control is implemented

4. **Development Environment**:
   - CSP is disabled in development to prevent eval() blocking
   - Server is running on localhost:3000
   - All required dependencies are installed

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### JWT Callback Flow:
1. User signs in with Google OAuth
2. `signIn` callback creates/updates user in database
3. `jwt` callback fetches user data from database (including role)
4. `session` callback provides user data to client

### Role-Based Access:
- Admin users can access `/admin/*` routes
- Non-admin users are redirected to `/unauthorized`
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`

## 🧪 Test Results

### Database Test:
```
✅ Admin user found: {
  id: 'cmdtftrs70007kz8x7q3kt4km',
  email: 'ryley92@gmail.com',
  role: 'Admin',
  isActive: true
}
```

### OAuth Configuration Test:
```
✅ NextAuth API is responding
Available providers: [ 'google', 'credentials' ]
✅ Google provider is configured
✅ All required environment variables are present
```

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The OAuth authentication system is now properly configured and ready for testing. Admin users should be able to:

1. Click "Sign In with Google" on the login page
2. Complete Google OAuth flow
3. Be redirected back to the app with Admin role
4. Access admin routes like `/admin/dashboard`

## 🔍 Next Steps

1. Test the complete OAuth flow in browser
2. Verify admin dashboard access
3. Test role-based redirects
4. Re-enable CSP for production deployment
