3. **Employee Creation** (`/employees/new/page.tsx`)
   - **Already Good**: `"Employee ${formData.name} has been created successfully."`

### Bulk Operations - Enhanced Messages:
1. **Bulk Shift Updates** (`/components/bulk-shift-operations.tsx`)
   - **Before**: `"Updated ${selectedShifts.length} shift(s) to ${status}"`
   - **After**: `"${selectedShifts.length} shift${selectedShifts.length === 1 ? '' : 's'} ha${selectedShifts.length === 1 ? 's' : 've'} been marked as ${status}."`

   - **Import Success Before**: `"Successfully imported ${validRows.length} rows"`
   - **Import Success After**: `"${validRows.length} record${validRows.length === 1 ? '' : 's'} ha${validRows.length === 1 ? 's' : 've'} been imported and processed."`
   
   - **Template Download Before**: "CSV template has been downloaded to your computer"
   - **Template Download After**: "CSV template has been downloaded and is ready to use."

## ‚úÖ **Forms with Proper Implementation (Already Good)**

2. **Job Edit** - ‚úÖ Complete (now enhanced)
3. **Shift Edit** - ‚úÖ Complete (now enhanced)
4. **Admin User Edit** - ‚úÖ Complete (now enhanced)
5. **Profile Edit** - ‚úÖ Complete
6. **Admin Employee Edit** - ‚úÖ Complete
